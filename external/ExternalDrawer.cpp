//File: ExternalDrawer.cpp
//Brief: Interface between drawing code and event display window.  Like EventDrawer ExternalDrawer is given a chance to request one or more 
//       Scene names from a Viewer. ExternalDrawer will not be given a TG4Event.  Instead, it gets a chance to connect to new TTreeReaders from 
//       which it must know how to extract the objects it needs.   
//       ExternalDrawer is the abstract base class for all plugins that can be used with the edepsim event display to process objects that are 
//       not from edepsim.  If you wrote your own metadata class that you want to stick into edepsim files, you are in the right place.
